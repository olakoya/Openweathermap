# OpenWeatherMap API Test Automation Framework

A professional test automation framework for OpenWeatherMap API, designed for robust backend QA validation. Includes functional, integration, and performance tests, environment configuration, and reporting.

---

## Overview

This project demonstrates:

- Comprehensive API testing of OpenWeatherMap endpoints (Current Weather, Forecast)
- Automated load and spike testing using Artillery
- Configuration-driven testing with `.env` support
- Clear reporting for CI/CD integration
- Reusable and maintainable test architecture

---

## Features

- **Functional Tests**: Validations for happy path, edge cases, and negative scenarios  
- **Integration Tests**: Consistency between endpoints and response validations  
- **Performance Tests**: Load and spike testing with Artillery  
- **Environment Configurable**: `.env` file for API keys and base URL  
- **Reporting**: Console output, HTML, and JUnit reports for CI pipelines  
- **Clean Architecture**: Service layer, reusable utilities, and structured test files

## Prerequisites

- Node.js v18.x or higher  
- npm v8+  
- OpenWeatherMap API key (free registration at [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/api))  

---

## Setup

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd openweathermap-api-tests

> 2. Install dependencies:

npm install

> 3. Create a .env file in the root:

OPENWEATHER_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
OPENWEATHER_BASE_URL=https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5
TEST_TIMEOUT=30000
ENABLE_DETAILED_LOGGING=true

**  Running Tests **
Functional & Integration Tests (Jest + TypeScript)**

npm test
npm run test:coverage    # With coverage reports
npm run test:ci          # For CI/CD pipelines

> ** Performance Tests (Artillery) **

npx dotenv -e .env -- npx artillery run perf/api-load-test.yml
npx dotenv -e .env -- npx artillery run perf/api-spike-test.yml
npx dotenv -e .env -- npx artillery run perf/api-smoke-test.yml

** Reporting **

HTML Reports: ./test-results/test-report.html

Coverage Reports: ./coverage/lcov-report/index.html

JUnit XML Reports: ./test-results/junit.xml (for CI/CD)

---

** Test Scenarios **

Functional Tests

PASS Get current weather by city name, coordinates, and city ID

PASS Validate response data types and temperature ranges

FAIL Handle invalid cities, coordinates, and parameters

- Edge cases (boundary coordinates, special characters)

Forecast API

PASS 5-day forecast by city or coordinates

PASS Validate time intervals and units

FAIL Invalid inputs handled gracefully

Performance Tests

âš¡ Load and spike testing

âš¡ Validate response time (< 2s)

âš¡ Monitor errors and throughput

Integration Tests

ðŸ”— Compare current weather vs forecast consistency

ðŸ”— Multiple methods same location validations

---

** CI/CD Integration **

GitHub Actions workflow included (.github/workflows/ci.yml)

Multi-node testing for Node.js 18 & 20

Linting, tests, performance tests, and artifact reporting

Requires repository secret: OPENWEATHER_API_KEY

---

** Troubleshooting **

Invalid API Key / Missing Env Variable: Ensure .env has OPENWEATHER_API_KEY

Rate Limiting (HTTP 429): Reduce requests or upgrade plan

Invalid Location (HTTP 404): Verify city name and country code

Timeouts: Increase TEST_TIMEOUT in .env

---

** Performance Considerations **

Free-tier rate limit: 60 requests/min

Typical response: < 2s

Concurrent requests limited by rate limits

---

** Contributing **

Fork the repository

Add/modify tests or utilities

Submit a pull request after validation
